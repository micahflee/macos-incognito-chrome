# Incognito Chrome

This is macOS app bundle for launching Google Chrome in incognito mode. To use:

- Install Google Chrome
- Drag "Incognito Chrome.app" to `/Applications`
- Remove "Google Chrome.app" from your dock, and add "Incognito Chrome.app" to it
- Open Incognito Chrome instead of Chrome from now on

Note that this only works if you don't already have a non-incognito Chrome window open. So close Chrome first.
